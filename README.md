## Project Description

### Motivation
The development of a terminal-based chess project is compelling because of the inherent complexities of the game that make it challenging to program. This project also gives us the opportunity to explore the principles of user interface design. It requires a thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms to implement.

### Languages, Tools, and Technologies
The project will primarily use C++ for programming the chess logic and interface. It will use the languageâ€™s standard input/output functionalities for handling moves and printing the game in the terminal. Beyond that, GitHub and Visual Studio Code will be used to create this program.

### Inputs and Outputs
The inputs will be moves entered in chess notation (e.g., " Qf7" to move the queen to f7). The output will display the current board state after each move within the terminal. The first output of the program is the starting screen that gives users the option to read instructions of the game, start a game, or exit. At the end of each game, a log of all the moves will be displayed in chess notation as well.
 
### Features
* Chess Logic: Implementing the traditional rules of chess, meaning legal moves for each piece, check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.
* Move Validation: Verifying the legality of moves and providing messages for illegal moves.
* Game State Management: Tracking the current board position, the player turns, available moves, and displaying the updated chessboard after each move.
* Terminal User Interface: Displaying the chessboard and game interface directly in the terminal.
* Two-Player Mode: Allows for a local multiplayer.


## User Interface Specification

### Navigation Diagram
The navigation diagram shows the process of a user playing through a chess game and the different options they can choose throughout. First, they are met with a menu that gives them the choice to start the game or view a page of instructions and rules of the game. Should they choose to start the game, a chessboard with the pieces in the starting positions is printed. Then the user is prompted to input their desired move, which updates the chessboard. At certain points, a user also has the opportunity to make a special move like castling, pawn promotion, etc. Users are allowed to exit the game at any time, which brings them to the end-of-game page. Once they view the log of all the moves made up to that point in chess notation, they can play again, rerouting them back to the main menu, or end the program.

           HOW TO PLAY    
---------------------------------

Chess is played on an 8x8 grid, with each player starting
with 16 pieces that move in distinct ways. To win, you must
checkmate your opponent's king.
Rules:
- Use chess notation for moves, e.g., "Ne6".
- A move is denoted by the piece's letter and its destination
  square, e.g., "Nf3" moves a knight to the f3 square.
- On the board each white piece is identified by an uppercase letter:
  R for Rook, N for Knight, B for Bishop, Q for Queen,
  K for King, and P for Pawn.
- On the board each black piece is identified by a lowercase letter:
  r for Rook, n for Knight, b for Bishop, q for Queen,
  k for King, and p for Pawn.
- The columns (files) are labeled a-h from left to right,
  and the rows (ranks) are labeled 1-8 from bottom to top.
- To capture, simply move your piece to the square occupied
  by an opponent's piece.
- Pawns are not denoted by letter, only by the destination
  square, e.g., "e4".
- Castling is indicated by "O-O" for kingside or "O-O-O" for
  queenside.

Special Moves:
- "en passant" is a special pawn capture.
- "promotion" occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest rank.

Commands:
- "e4": To move a pawn to e4.
- "exit": Exit the current game and return to the main menu.
- "help": Show a list of commands and rules.

Type your commands or moves when prompted during gameplay.

## Class Diagram
<img src="UML Class Diagram.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Our game will be comprised of 4 main classes, the game itself, the board, the squares on the board, and the game pieces. The Game class has the primary controls over the game, such as switching turns and saving the game log afterwards. It will also hold the logic for determining whether inputs are valid, and when they are, whether they are legal moves or not. The Board class controls an 8x8 matrix of Squares, simulating a chessboard and holds the primary controls for moving the pieces themselves, and contains the graphics that the game will print out for the user. The Square class helps calculate all possible moves of the piece within the square, assisting in checking the legality of moves. Finally, the Piece class contains data that determines what each unique piece can do, and which side it belongs to, making sure it moves in the correct directions and captures the correct pieces.
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on Zoom and should be conducted by Wednesday of week 8.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

UML Diagram Updates:
* We added two int type parameters to the getSquare function in Board class. These parameters are for the file and rank of the Square that the function is getting. This change in code adheres to the Open-Closed Principle because it is extending the Square class instead of directly modifying it. The function returns a Square, which is the class associated with Board. It leads to better code because it now clarifies the specific Square parameters that are needed to return something for the function.
* We added individual private helper functions to the Board class for the public function getLegalMoves(). These functions are called to find the possible legal moves that can be made for each individual piece. This adheres to the Interface-Segregation Principle because the functions are only called when their corresponding piece needs to check its legal move, so the pieces are separated from each other.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
